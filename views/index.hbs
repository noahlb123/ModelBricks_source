<h3 class="pageSubheading">Each ModelBrick contains</h3>
<ol>
<li>Sets of molecules (species) uniquely identified with universal identifiers, their initial concentrations and transport properties.
Reaction(s) (changes in state) identified by known biochemical mechanisms and defined by a flux reaction with parameters for forward and reverse rates (kf and kr).  Flux terms can be simple mass action kinetics or complex functions.
<li>An identified cellular Compartment(s) where the reaction occurs and the species reside.
<li>A Publication ID or other identifier of the author and peer-review status for the original model from which a ModelBrick is derived
