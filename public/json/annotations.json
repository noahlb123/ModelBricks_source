Serves as a link between cell surface \r\r\n    receptors and Rap/Ras GTPases in intracellular signaling cascades. Acts \r\r\n    also as an effector for Rap1 by direct association with Rap1-GTP thereby \r\r\n    leading to the amplification of Rap1-mediated signaling. Shows weak \r\r\n    activity on HRAS. It is controversial whether RAPGEF2 binds cAMP and cGMP \r\r\n    (PubMed:23800469, PubMed:10801446) or not (PubMed:10608844, &lt;a \r\r\n    href=http://cnn.com&gt;PubMed:10548487&lt;/a&gt; (http://cnn.com), \r\r\n    PubMed:11359771). Its binding to ligand-activated beta-1 adrenergic \r\r\n    receptor ADRB1 leads to the Ras activation through the G(s)-alpha \r\r\n    signaling pathway. Involved in the cAMP-induced Ras and Erk1/2 signaling \r\r\n    pathway that leads to sustained inhibition of long term melanogenesis by \r\r\n    reducing dendrite extension and melanin synthesis. Provides also \r\r\n    inhibitory signals for cell proliferation of melanoma cells and promotes \r\r\n    their apoptosis in a cAMP-independent nanner. Regulates cAMP-induced \r\r\n    neuritogenesis by mediating the Rap1/B-Raf/ERK signaling through a pathway \r\r\n    that is independent on both PKA and RAPGEF3/RAPGEF4. Involved in neuron \r\r\n    migration and in the formation of the major forebrain fiber connections \r\r\n    forming the corpus callosum, the anterior commissure and the hippocampal \r\r\n    commissure during brain development. Involved in neuronal growth factor \r\r\n    (NGF)-induced sustained activation of Rap1 at late endosomes and in \r\r\n    brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-induced axon outgrowth of \r\r\n    hippocampal neurons. Plays a role in the regulation of embryonic blood \r\r\n    vessel formation and in the establishment of basal junction integrity and \r\r\n    endothelial barrier function. May be involved in the regulation of the \r\r\n    vascular endothelial growth factor receptor KDR and cadherin CDH5 \r\r\n    expression at allantois endothelial cell-cell junctions.\r\r\n  </body>\r\r\n</html>\r\r\n"},{"$":{"name":"MolecularType(Activator)"},"_":"<html>\r\n  <head>\r\n    \r\n  </head>\r\n  <body>\r\n    <span charset=\"utf-8\" align=\"left\" style=\"letter-spacing: normal; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; display: inline !important; float: none\"><font color=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" face=\"Verdana, Arial, sans-serif\" size=\"13px\">Receptor \r\n    tyrosine kinase binding ligands of the EGF family and activating several \r\n    signaling cascades to convert extracellular cues into appropriate cellular \r\n    responses (PubMed:</font></span><a href=\"https://www.uniprot.org/citations/8404850\" align=\"left\" style=\"text-indent: 0px; border-bottom-style: none; border-bottom-width: medium; letter-spacing: normal; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px\"><font color=\"rgb(0, 112, 155)\" face=\"Verdana, Arial, sans-serif\" size=\"13px\">8404850</font></a><span align=\"left\" style=\"letter-spacing: normal; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; display: inline !important; float: none\"><font color=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" face=\"Verdana, Arial, sans-serif\" size=\"13px\">). \r\n    Known ligands include EGF, TGFA/TGF-alpha, AREG, epigen/EPGN, \r\n    BTC/betacellulin, epiregulin/EREG and HBEGF/heparin-binding EGF. Ligand \r\n    binding triggers receptor homo- and/or heterodimerization and \r\n    autophosphorylation on key cytoplasmic residues. The phosphorylated \r\n    receptor recruits adapter proteins like GRB2 which in turn activates \r\n    complex downstream signaling cascades. Activates at least 4 major \r\n    downstream signaling cascades including the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK, PI3 \r\n    kinase-AKT, PLCgamma-PKC and STATs modules. May also activate the \r\n    NF-kappa-B signaling cascade. Also directly phosphorylates other proteins \r\n    like RGS16, activating its GTPase activity and probably coupling the EGF \r\n    receptor signaling to the G protein-coupled receptor signaling. Also \r\n    phosphorylates MUC1 and increases its interaction with SRC and \r\n    CTNNB1/beta-catenin (By similarity). Positively regulates cell migration \r\n    via interaction with CCDC88A/GIV which retains EGFR at the cell membrane \r\n    following ligand stimulation, promoting EGFR signaling which triggers cell \r\n    migration (By similarity). Plays a role in enhancing learning and memory \r\n    performance (PubMed:</font></span><a href=\"https://www.uniprot.org/citations/20639532\" align=\"left\" style=\"text-indent: 0px; border-bottom-style: none; border-bottom-width: medium; letter-spacing: normal; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px\"><font color=\"rgb(0, 112, 155)\" face=\"Verdana, Arial, sans-serif\" size=\"13px\">20639532</font></a><span align=\"left\" style=\"letter-spacing: normal; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; display: inline !important; float: none\"><font color=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" face=\"Verdana, Arial, sans-serif\" size=\"13px\">).</font></span>\r\n  </body>\r\n</html>\r\n"}],"url":[]}}
